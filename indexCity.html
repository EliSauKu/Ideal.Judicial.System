    <div class="popupj" id="popupj">
      <p><b>Click on the text and use the direction keys in order to scroll up or down as you read.</b></p>
           <p>The General Principles of Law include fundamental ideas that inform our legal system, 
             which consist of:
	
            <ol type="I">
             <li> Good faith</li>
            <li> Not to hurt others</li>
            <li> Compensation of damages caused by a negligent act</li>
            <li> Private autonomy (pacta sunt servanda)</li>
            </ol>
         <p> Having mentioned these important points, I think it is quite crucial to remember that in order for us to distinguish
           between "good" or "bad" practices, we will have to respond to the demands of the moral rules that exist in our society.
           We can for example, always use axiology as a branch to assist us. When deciding whether certain laws can be accepted or
           not in today´s world, we have to use our morality, as it allows us to see attitudes or customs that can be changed
           (and vice versa). <br><br>
           We also find usually two systems: Civil Law and Common Law. <br> Civil Law is the system based on rules 
           and concepts that come from Roman law. Unlike in Common Law, these legal codes clearly explain everyone's rights and
           duties - the cases that can be brought to court, the procedures and the applicable punishment for an offense. 
           In criminal cases they establish the facts of a case and use the applicable codes. <br>
           Common Law is also referred as Case Law, and it´s a body consisting of unwritten laws based on legal established
           precedents by the court. It draws from institutionalized opinions and interpretations from judicial authorities and
           public juries. Civil Law is traced back to the code of laws compiled in the Roman Empire, while Common Law is set back
           to the English monarchy period. <br><br>
           Although many countries use now mixed systems, I believe Common Law would be a much more beneficial and useful option
           for our society as one of the main reasons is that it can be changed (it is flexible). Furthermore, having every single
           law written somewhere, it provides a sense of false sense of certainty when making important decisions. <br> Also, one of
           the advantages of Common Law is that people can interpret and apply the law to a particular unique situation with different,
           unique facts too when making choices everytime, so it is not so fixed. Each human has unique experiences and situations, so 
           for this exact reason I believe that laws should be more flexible in order to fit each person´s situations, actions, and
           the respective procedures in order to address each case.

      <div class="popupf" id="popupf">
        <p><b>Click on the text and use the direction keys in order to scroll up or down as you read.</b></p>
        <p>The Statute of Limitations is the time limit to the exercise of subjective rights
          that can cause the extinction of actions <i>(Art. 1.961 CC: “Actions come into prescription for the simple lapse of time
          provided by law”).</i> <br>
          The Prescription periods starts at the moment in which the action arises. It does not have automatic effects but once
          pleaded it takes effect from the date when the statute of limitation period terminated. The Prescription must be also
          alleged by the defendant. <br><br>
          Given the time period in each case, and these periods being able to be interrupted by judicial claims, extrajudicial
          claims or acknowledgment of debt, I believe they are good steps in order to deal with the different cases in court. 
          As the interruption operates as a renewal of the period, this can give the person more time if he or she (for example)
          suffered from a serious event after the case action arised.

      <div class="popupl" id="popupl">
         <p><b>Click on the text and use the direction keys in order to scroll up or down as you read.</b></p>
         <p> The main requirements are:<br>
          <i>1.</i> Any act or omission that produces damage, <br>
          <i>2.</i> Fault or negligence: omission of the necessary diligence to prevent the damage. This basically means
          that either the person had the intention to cause the damage, or he did not act with sufficient diligence
          in order to prevent such damage to happen. <br>
          <i>3.</i> Damage: the obligation to compensate only arises when the negligent conduct causes damage. Damage consists
          of loss + loss of profit. It can be inflicted to property and/or to persons. <br>
          <i>4.</i> There should be a causality link between the action and the damage caused as a consequence.
          The limits of the civil liability are force majeure, intervention of a third party, and the fault of the victim 
          (if there are concurrence of faults the consequences of the damage will be distributed between the agent and the
          victim). <br><br>

          These points are the ones necessaryin order for a procedure to take place I believe, as they describe clearly the 
          actions and the steps taken. We then encounter another point though, when the person is found under the responsibility
          of another one (such as parents or tutors for their children, employers for their employees, etc), and as greatly stated,
          the grounds for this liability is the lack of proper watch over, education or election of a more suitable person for the
          specific job. of the situation.

        <p><b>Click on the text and use the direction keys in order to scroll up or down as you read.</b></p>
        <p>One of the concepts that really caught my attention is civil or natural capacity. It is as explained,
          the capacity to hold legal rights. It starts with birth and ends with death. Nobody can be deprived of
          civil capacity, and this is because each human being has a legal personality (acquired at the time of
          birth), as he or she is recognized as a person. <br><br>

          Another term is the legal capacity, the capacity to manage and exercise	the legal rights and obligations
          that a person holds. Natural persons obtain this capacity when they turn 18, being capable for all acts of
          the civil life, except for the exceptions set for special cases such as adoption, etc. I believe this is
          a sensible decision as young adults when reaching 18 years of age can show many signs of maturity if educated 
          well from young age. <br><br>

          However, and as it is stated in the Law, minors have their legal capacity limited and they cannot validly give 
          conset by themselves because they are not considered to be mature enough to take most decisions. What I support
          as well is the fact that they can (in some specific cases) provide their opinions to be taken into account, because 
          as members of society they should not be ignored either. <br><br>
          Emancipation is important too for the teenager´s life because it can be useful in certain cases. This status can be
          granted by the parents, by a judge, via marriage or via an independent life from the parents (physically and
          economically) with the parent´s consent. <br><br>

          Limitation or deprivation of a person´s legal capacity by a judge is necessary too because as stated before, the person
          has a mental or physical impossibility to understand the consequences of his/her acts, they are simply not aware.
          This is applied if the person presents a persistent mental or physical illness, advanced age, chronic use of drugs
          and any other anomaly so it leadisthe person to not having enough understanding to perform legal acts.
